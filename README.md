## Elevation profiles of trails in Bryce Canyon National Park

For this 3D map, I interpolated shapefiles of trails into a digital elevation model of the area. I split the trails into each named segment, generated a stack profile for each, and then displayed each elevation profile as a separate chart, as shown in the picture below. I wrote [some code](https://github.com/jbelian/bryce/blob/main/find_min_max.ipynb) in Python that loops through each trail's attribute table and finds the minimum and maximum height of each. Additionally, a goal of this project was practical experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS). I learned how to run an EC2 server, uploaded the resulting [CSV file](https://github.com/jbelian/bryce/blob/main/trails_min_max_elev.csv) to it, and played around with the file with some command line functions.
